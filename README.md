## Pseudocode to explain the more complex parts
when user clicks on a number button, the number is stored into a variable called num1 and the number is displayed on the screen. Then clicks on one of the math operators. Then the user clicks on another number button, the number is stored into a variable called num2 and the number is displayed on the screen.
Finally they click on the equal sign button and the result number is displayed on the screen.
